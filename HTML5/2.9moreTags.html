    <h2 align="center">Choosing Your Tags</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Generic: &lt;p&gt;,&lt;div&gt; 
        <p>
        Paragraph and div tags are block tags.That break your code into nice sections.
        Paragraph is kind of self-explanatory,and div gives you a way to put groups of contents
        together.But the problem is that the're  very generic.So we want to move over these Semantic
        tags such as header and nav,footer and figure.
        </p>
    </li>
        <li>Semantics: &lt;header&gt;,&lt;nav&gt;,&lt;footer&gt;,&lt;figure&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Some of other block tags that you may not be familiar with are listed here.
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">Block Tags</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Containers
            <ul type="disc"><li>
                &lt;article&gt;,&lt;aside&gt;,&lt;section&gt;,&lt;main&gt;,......
            </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li> &lt;hr&gt; </li>
        <li> &lt;address&gt; </li>
        <li> &lt;blockquote&gt;-has cite attribute </li>
        <li> &lt;detail&gt;with &lt;summary&gt; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Some of the other block tags that you may not be familiar with are listed here.
        The first one are the containers.Containers are simple things where you can put like-minded code together.
        So you might have an article or an aside,a section made.Again,they almost in their names.But as you grow
        more comfortable,as you'are designing your website,you can start to see oh,this isn't a generic section.
        This really is an aside.The next block tag is hr,or horizontal rule.And it's really an interesting idea
        because it doesn't contain any text at all.Just to remind you,block tags are tags that have the display block.
        It means it forces a new line above and below.There is never going to be anything next to it by default.
        So,our hard rule will just put a single line across your page,simple yet very much used by many people.
        The next one is address.This will go ahead and be block tag,and it doesn't format your address any differently
        than other text.But what it does is ,it allows screen readers and other assisted devices to quickly and easily
        find if they are looking for your address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Block quote &lt;blockquote&gt; will be another block tag as well as detils.
    </p>
    <p>Now the details tag is very interesting in this kind of quote you get into work.And what it does is elastic hand having
        drop down open and close idea with your text.Now,just warn you it is not implemented in Firefox so
        if you are someone with Firefox who tries to run it its just gonna kinda default to open idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alright,so there's &lt;hr&gt;,&lt;address&gt;,&lt;blockquote&gt;,and &lt;detail&gt;s.

    <h2 align="center">Inline tags</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;span&gt; was the original inline tag for plain text.</li>
        <li>&lt;cite&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;abbr&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;time&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;code&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;</li>
    </ul>
